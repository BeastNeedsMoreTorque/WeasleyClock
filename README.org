* Weasley clock

  Build a working physical Weasley Clock from Harry Potter. 

  Photo album: https://photos.app.goo.gl/7yxiuzpsFReUh5Yy5

** Design Goals/Plans
  - use a Raspberry Pi to control clock via servos and servo hat
  - physical hands, each moving independently
  - four (4) physical hands, one for each family member
  - build my own clockwork
  - program in python
  - use live GPS data of family members
  - GPS updates from one or more of: iCloud, Owntracks, life360, local MQTT, and/or local network device scanning
** Case Design
  - I decided to reuse an old grandfather/grandmother clock instead of
    building a new case. I got lucky and found a perfect case at a
    thrift shop. I needed the dimensions of the face to match the
    artwork I have and the depth of the case needed to hold the servos
    and new clockwork.
** Clock hands
  - goal is something like the metallic scissors w/ engraved names
  - mounting could be with 3D printing with a built in clamp
  - possibly use same Clamping Hubs as for the gears

** Artwork
  - https://minalima.com/product/the-weasley-family-clock/
  - clock face dimensions: 
     + width 9.75"
     + height of square face 9.5"
     + total height 13.5"
     + top semi-circle indentation: 1"
     + top semi-circle height: 4"
     + clock face radius: 4"
** Clockwork
  - clockwork depth: 4.125" (behind the face)
  - clockwork width: 6.625"
  - clockwork height: 3"
  - hands depth:     2"     (with 0.125" clearance from glass)
** Home Assistant
I am using [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) for
tracking and transmitting the location of my family members. To do
this I am using the (Life360
integration)[https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/life360/] for
detailed location tracking. For tracking finer locations around the
house I am using the (Unifi
integration)[https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/unifi] to
montor which WiFi access point each family member is closest to.

I'm including example Home Assistant YAML configuration code creating
a Weasley Clock sensor. This sensor will track a given user's Weasley
Clock states:  home, garden, school, work, intransit, mortalperil, lost, error.

 * home/school/work/lost/intransit/lost states are determined by life360 location
 * garden state is based on which of the home WiFi access points is being used
 * mortalperil is triggered by life360 detecting speeds over 75 mph
 * error is triggered if the life360 device_tracker returns None type

Example Home Assistant configrations can be found in the
homeassistant/ directory.

** Raspberry Pi
 + standard set of Raspberry pi requirements. Pi, power supply, SD card, case
** Servo Hat
 + Raspberry Pi servo hat: https://www.adafruit.com/product/2327
   - requires soldering
 + Servo power, one of:
   - 5V 2A should be enough if motors aren't overloaded simultaneously https://www.adafruit.com/product/276
   - 5V 4A to hedge bets, or if you run more servos https://www.adafruit.com/product/1466

** Shopping list from Hobbylinc
 +  https://www.hobbylinc.com/htm/k+s/k+s9821.htm
 + NOTE: checked items are a good set for a 4 hand clock. Theoretically
   possible to create a 6 hand clock with all of the sizes. However,
   servocity doesn't sell clamping hubs for size 2mm and 7mm.
 + parts:

** Notes on parts
 + https://www.servocity.com/32p-24t-c1-spline-servo-mount-gears-metal
   NOTE: The 32 tooth gears don't fully clear the servo body. This
   means that to use more than one servo, we need to use a shaft so
   that central 64 tooth gears don't hit/interfere with the servos.
 + Using 64 tooth gears mounted to the brass tubes. This gives a clean
   1:2 ration from the servos.
 + HS-785HB Servo
   - specs https://www.robotshop.com/media/files/pdf/hs-785hb.pdf
   - Grabcad model https://grabcad.com/library/hitec-hs-785hb-winch-servo-1
   - The HS-785HB Servos have a claimed 8 full rotations. I only need
     2 full rotations to get the full range of motion of the clock
     hands. Having more than 360 degrees of motion allows for a little
     *flair* when positioning the hands. I'm going to use just 6 full
     rotations of the servo (so 3 full rotations of the hands) to
     avoid using the extremes of the PWM signals to the servos.
   - Stall current for HS-785HB is 1500mA. Max current 6A (at 5V?)
   - No load current for HS-785HB is 230mA
   - Idle current for HS-785HB is 9mA
 + possible screws for attaching to clamping hubs? 6-32
   - SKU 91771A145  length 0.3125" (5/16")  <  0.333" = 0.25" (hub width) + 0.083" (screw head depth)

** CAD Models of Parts

Most of the parts from ServoCity.com have CAD models. I found a CAD
model for the Servo on GrabCad.com (link above).

I have collected all the available [CAD Files](CAD/library) in the
[CAD](CAD) sub-directory. For all the ServoCity CAD files, check out
the [ServoCity.com website](https://www.servocity.com/step-files).

** Mounting poster to plywood
 + Use 3M Super 77 Spray Adhesive for mounting the clock face artwork. After some experimentation, I think
this will be better than using Mod Podge as I originally though. The
3M product does not get as wet, and doesn't have to saturate the paper
like the Mod Podge does. This leaves the face surface smoother, and
doesn't require coating the front of the art to get good adhesion.
 + Or use Mod Podge water based glue to tack the poster to the wood clock face

 + The current clock body will allow me to hide the mounting screws
   and make interchanging the face possible.
