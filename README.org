* Weasly clock

  Build a working physical Weasley Clock from Harry Potter. 

  Photo album: https://photos.app.goo.gl/7yxiuzpsFReUh5Yy5

** Design Goals/Plans
  - use a Raspberry Pi to control clock via servos and servo hat
  - physical hands, each moving independently
  - four (4) physical hands, one for each family member
  - build my own clockwork
  - program in python
  - use live GPS data of family members
  - GPS updates from one or more of: iCloud, Owntracks, life360, local MQTT, and/or local network device scanning
** Case Design
  - I decided to reuse an old grandfather/grandmother clock instead of
    building a new case. I got lucky and found a perfect case at a
    thrift shop. I needed the dimensions of the face to match the
    artwork I have and the depth of the case needed to hold the servos
    and new clockwork.
** Clock hands
  - goal is something like the metalic scissors w/ engraved names
  - mounting could be with 3D printing with a built in clamp
  - possibly use same Clamping Hubs as for the gears

** Artwork
  - https://minalima.com/product/the-weasley-family-clock/
  - clock face dimentions: 
     + width 9.75"
     + height of square face 9.5"
     + total height 13.5"
     + top semi-circle indentation: 1"
     + top semi-circle height: 4"
     + clock face radius: 4"
** Clockwork
  - clockwork depth: 4.125" (behind the face)
  - clockwork width: 6.625"
  - clockwork hight: 3"
  - hands depth:     2"     (with 0.125" clearance from glass)
* Shoppting list
** Raspberry Pi
 + standard set of Raspberry pi requirements. Pi, power supply, SD card, case
** Servo Hat
 + Raspberry Pi servo hat: https://www.adafruit.com/product/2327
   - requires soldering
 + Servo power, one of:
   - 5V 2A should be enough if motors aren't overloaded simutaneously https://www.adafruit.com/product/276
   - 5V 4A to hedge bets, or if you run more servso https://www.adafruit.com/product/1466

** Shopping list from Hobbylinc
 +  https://www.hobbylinc.com/htm/k+s/k+s9821.htm
 + NOTE: checked items are a good set for a 4 hand clock. Theoretically
   possible to create a 6 hand clock with all of the sizes. However,
   servocity doesn't sell clamping hubs for size 2mm and 7mm.
 + parts:
   - [ ] 2mm x 300mm Round Brass Tube .45mm Wall (4) k+s9820 Item # K+S9820
   - [X] 3mm x 300mm Round Brass Tube .45mm Wall (4) k+s9821 Item # K+S9821
   - [X] 4mm x 300mm Round Brass Tube .45mm Wall (3) k+s9822 Item # K+S9822 
   - [X] 5mm x 300mm Round Brass Tube .45mm Wall (3) k+s9823 Item # K+S9823
   - [X] 6mm x 300mm Round Brass Tube .45mm Wall (2) k+s9824 Item # K+S9824
   - [ ] 7mm x 300mm Round Brass Tube .45mm Wall (2) k+s9825 Item # K+S9825
** Notes on parts
 + https://www.servocity.com/32p-24t-c1-spline-servo-mount-gears-metal
   NOTE: The 32 tooth gears don't fully clear the servo body. This
   means that to use more than one servo, we need to use a shaft so
   that central 64 tooth gears don't hit/interfere with the servos.
 + Using 64 tooth gears mounted to the brass tubes. This gives a clean
   1:2 ration from the servos.
 + HS-785HB Servo
   - specs https://www.robotshop.com/media/files/pdf/hs-785hb.pdf
   - Grabcad model https://grabcad.com/library/hitec-hs-785hb-winch-servo-1
   - The HS-785HB Servos have a claimed 8 full rotations. I only need
     2 full rotations to get the full range of motion of the clock
     hands. Having more than 360 degrees of motion allows for a little
     *flair* when positioning the hands. I'm going to use just 6 full
     rotations of the servo (so 3 full rotations of the hands) to
     avoid using the extremes of the PWM signals to the servos.
   - Stall current for HS-785HB is 1500mA. Max current 6A (at 5V?)
   - No load current for HS-785HB is 230mA
   - Idle current for HS-785HB is 9mA
 + possible screws for attaching to clamping hubs? 6-32
   - SKU 91771A145  length 0.3125" (5/16")  <  0.333" = 0.25" (hub width) + 0.083" (screw head depth)
