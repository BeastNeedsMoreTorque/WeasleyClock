* Weasly clock

  Build a working physical Weasley Clock from Harry Potter. 

** Design Goals/Plans
  - use a Raspberry Pi to control clock via servos and servo hat
  - physical hands, each moving independently
  - four (4) physical hands, one for each family member
  - build my own clockwork
  - program in python
  - use live GPS data of family members
  - GPS updates from one or more of: iCloud, Owntracks, life360, local MQTT, and/or local network device scanning

   NOTE: These don't clear the servo body, need a smaller servo? or stagger the
   gears.

** Shopping list from Hobbylinc
 +  https://www.hobbylinc.com/htm/k+s/k+s9821.htm
 + NOTE: checked items are a good set for a 4 hand clock. Theoretically
   possible to create a 6 hand clock with all of the sizes. However,
   servocity doesn't sell clamping hubs for size 2mm and 7mm.

** Notes on parts
 - https://www.servocity.com/32p-24t-c1-spline-servo-mount-gears-metal
   NOTE: The 32 tooth gears don't fully clear the servo body. This
   means that to use more than one servo, we need to use a shaft so
   that central 64 tooth gears don't hit/interfere with the servos.
 - Using 64 tooth gears mounted to the brass tubes. This gives a clean
   1:2 ration from the servos.
 - The HS-785HB Servos have a claimed 8 full rotations. I only need 2
   full rotations to get the full range of motion of the clock
   hands. Having more than 360 degrees of motion allows for a little
   *flair* when positioning the hands. I'm going to use just 6 full
   rotations of the servo (so 3 full rotations of the hands) to avoid
   using the extremes of the PWM signals to the servos.
